Class for Instagram API
Updated: 5/7/16
Now Supports Facebook and Twitter. 
Class now pulls twitter information. After taking that information
it takes the user name and full name of the user you originally looked up
and goes through facebook to find the person. Afterwards using the facebook and twitter
information, we now look for the instagram infromation.
